# m

m is a succinct & expressive programming language, where efficiency and elegance meet. It aims to support imperative and functional programming paradigms and is designed with zero-overhead abstraction whenever possible.

It is under active development, currently it supports following features
- arithmetic operators
  - \+    addition
  - \-    subtraction
  - \*    multiplication
  - /    division

- relational operators:
  - == equality
  - \>  greater than
  - \>= greater than or equals
  - \<  less than
  - \<= less than or equals
  - \!= not equal

- logical operators:
  - \|| or
  - && and
  - ! not

- control flows
  - if..then..else
  - for loop

- operator overload
  
  for examples
  - binary: ```(|>) x f = f x```
  - unary: ```(!) x = 0 - x```
