The best way of introducing a new language is to produce the famous program printing "hello world !" to the terminal on different operating system.

1. create a new "helloworld.m" source file containing m code:
```
main () = printf "hello world !\n"
```
2. compile it into executable 
```
m $ m -o helloworld helloworld.m
```
on Windows you need to add .exe extension to the output file
```
m -o helloworld.exe helloworld.m
```

3. execute helloworld program
```
m $ helloworld
hello world !
```
